#Tenzies Game
A fun and interactive Tenzies Game built with React. The objective is to roll the dice and try to get all the dice to show the same number. Each time you click a die, it "freezes" in place, and you keep rolling the rest of the dice until all are the same.

Features:
10 dice to roll.
- Freeze individual dice to keep them from rolling.
- Track the number of rolls it takes to win.
- Clean and interactive interface.

Technologies Used:

- React for building the user interface.
- Tailwind CSS for styling the game.
- Vite for fast development setup.

How to Play:
1. Click on the dice to freeze them in place.
2. Roll the remaining dice.
3. Repeat the process until all dice show the same number.
4. The game keeps track of the number of rolls you make.
